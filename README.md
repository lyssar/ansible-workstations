# Ansible Workstation setups

This repo aims to provide a set of ansible tasks to setup a workstation after a fresh OS install. This includes download of programs and setting up a complete workstation for my needs. This includes php, k8s, k3sup, Lens, nodejs, yarn and diffrent other programs for my daily work. In each sub folder is a seperate README to see how to use each setup.
